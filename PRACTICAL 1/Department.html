 <h5>About the Department</h5>

<p>The Economics Department of Ramanujan College takes pride in being among the best departments for the study of Economics at the undergraduate level. It comprises a young and dynamic faculty with diverse specializations and interests.
</p>
<p>
It was in July 2013 that the B.A. (Honours) Economics programme was introduced in Ramanujan College under the guidance of Professors of the Delhi School of Economics.
</p>
<p>
The teaching methodology at Ramanujan combines standard methods of University education – lectures and tutorials – with written assignments, project work, field trips, and student presentations both in class and in seminars. The faculty endeavours to preserve the vibrant academic atmosphere in order to provide high quality Economics education from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
</p>
<p>
All activities of the Department are aimed at encouraging students in various extra-curricular and co-curricular activities, which encourages them to explore beyond the frontiers of the prescribed syllabus, evaluate economic issues and interact with experts from diverse areas of specialization. In this respect, the Economics Society of the Department “Essenzia” organizes a variety of events to promote students’ interest in the subject.  Essenzia activities are extended to encompass areas of research, career and literary interactions through its wings viz. Essenzia Research Wing (ERW), Essenzia Career Wing (ECW) and Samvaad, the literary discussion circle.
</p>
<p>
The department and its society conducts its operations and extension activities taking into consideration its social objective of inclusiveness. In light of the same, the Economics Society’s Outreach initiative, Zariya, is a collaborative effort of the students and teachers of the department to contribute towards the upliftment of the society in various ways. Additionally, to ensure inclusivity among the students of the department coming diverse cultural, ethnic and racial backgrounds, the department regular conducts Open House Sessions to encourage positive interaction among students and teachers.
</p>
<h5>
Scope of the Subject
</h5>
<p>
The study of economics as a discipline encourages analytical thinking and a pragmatic approach to economic problems. At Ramanujan College, there is an emphasis on providing a strong foundation in economic theory, along with the focus on issues specific to the Indian context. Such a process of rational decision-making is of great value in any career a person chooses.
</p>
<p>
It provides a platform for varied vocations like IES, IAS, MBA, MFC, MBE etc. Those with an inclination towards banking and marketing can opt for MBA; while more academically oriented students can pursue M.A. and Ph.D in Economics. The Civil Services and the Planning Commission are still very popular pursuits for those interested in administration and framing economic policies.
